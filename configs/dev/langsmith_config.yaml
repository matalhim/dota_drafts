# LangSmith configuration for monitoring and debugging LLM calls
# Get your API key from https://smith.langchain.com/

# Enable/disable tracing (set to true to enable)
# Supports both LANGSMITH_TRACING and LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2 env vars
tracing_enabled: true

# Project name for organizing traces in LangSmith
# LangSmith automatically creates projects when first used
# If you want to use an existing project (like "default"), set it here
# If the project doesn't exist, it will be created automatically on first trace
# Supports both LANGSMITH_PROJECT and LANGCHAIN_PROJECT env vars
project_name: "dota-drafts"  # Change to "default" to use existing default project

# Optional: LangSmith endpoint (defaults to https://api.smith.langchain.com)
# endpoint: "https://api.smith.langchain.com"

# Optional: Set tags for filtering traces in LangSmith dashboard
# Tags are strings that help you filter and organize traces
# Example: tags: ["production", "rag", "draft-analysis"]
# You can filter by tags in LangSmith UI: https://smith.langchain.com/
tags: ["dota-drafts", "rag"]

# Note: Metadata is set per-invocation in code, not here
# To add metadata to specific LLM calls, use callbacks or pass metadata directly
# Example in code:
#   from langchain_core.callbacks import CallbackManager
#   from langsmith import traceable
#   
#   @traceable(metadata={"version": "0.0.1", "environment": "dev"})
#   def my_function():
#       ...
